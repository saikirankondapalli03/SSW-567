1. What challenges did you encounter with this assignment if any?
> the challenge for me was to find out the testcases where my code fails
2. What did you think about the requirements specification for this assignment?
>  It is a simple mathematical question.  So it was easier to implement. 
3. What challenges did you encounter with the tools?
>  there are no challenges for me, as python was already setup in my vs code.
4. Describe the criteria you used to determine that you had sufficient test cases, i.e. how did you know you were done?
>  I followed  incremental approach  of testing. where i first tested basic "success" scenarios of right angled triangle, scalene, isosceles, equilateral. After ensuring that my code is working fine for basic scenarios, i started with figuring out test cases that will test negative scenarios. After that i went with edge cases and i figured out that my code will not work for arguments of float.
