1. What challenges did you encounter with this assignment if any?
> the challenge for me was to find out the testcases where my code fails
2. What did you think about the requirements specification for this assignment?
>  It is a simple mathematical question
3. What challenges did you encounter with the tools?
>  there are no challenges for me, as python was already setup
4. Describe the criteria you used to determine that you had sufficient test cases, i.e. how did you know you were done?
>  I took the approach of taking edge cases, positive cases and invalid cases. I figured out the test  cases for which my code fails.
